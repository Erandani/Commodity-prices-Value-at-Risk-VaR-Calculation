# Gold-prices-Value-at-Risk-VaR-Calculation


Value at Risk (VaR) is a measure of the potential loss in an investment portfolio over a specific time horizon and at a given confidence level. VaR can be used to estimate the risk of an investment in gold prices by calculating the maximum amount of loss that could be expected with a given level of confidence. The calculation takes into account the historical volatility of gold prices and other market factors. VaR can help investors make informed decisions and manage their portfolios effectively by providing an estimate of the potential risk involved.
